## Synopsis

NOT READY FOR REUSE.  THIS IS AN INTERIM VERSION FOR TESTING DEPLOYMENT ISSUES.

Python Django Rest Framework API implementation 
of the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) and Watershed Boundary Dataset.  Provides a
complete API to navigate the HUC/WBD dataset(s) in JSON and XML formats.

Two sample clients are also included. 'Chart' provides a D3js implementation of 
a WBD browser. 'Map' provides a map-based implementation of a WBD navigation too.
